This directory contains the relevant IDL routines used to extract dust continuum data and then compare these to models. The directory "scuba" contains the routines used to do the aperture photometry of the SCUBA maps, including the error analysis.

The "dusty" directory contains the routines used to do the entire DUSTY analysis. For a normal run, only one script should be modified: "result_dusty_beam.pro". 

- The user may want to change the weighting of the SCUBA versus other photometry points on the SED; this is done in lines 31-34. 

- The user will almost certainly need to change the initial guesses of Y and tau used when determining alpha. These parameters need to be changed and updated in line 109 and 130 and should be re-changed/updated when the best-fit values for Y and tau have been determined in the SED modelling. 

- I put in a constraint that the envelope radius should be between 45 and 90". If the radius is unconstrained, lines 137 and 138 should be uncommented and commented, respectively.

- Finally, don't forget to update the DUSTY and home directories in lines 22 and 82.
